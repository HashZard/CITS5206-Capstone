# CITS5206-Capstone

## Project Overview
Language-Based Geographic Reasoning is a web platform that turns natural language questions (e.g., “Show all rivers in Europe”) into optimised PostGIS SQL queries, executes the spatial analysis, and delivers interactive map visualisations within seconds. The system lowers the learning curve of traditional GIS tools by combining LLM-powered query translation, multi-step clarification, and a multi-level table selection mechanism that improves accuracy while reducing processing overhead. Our MVP targets university GIS professionals, students, and broader non-GIS users who need fast, reliable access to spatial insights.
